# Slides — Agent Guide

This app follows the agent-native core philosophy: the agent and UI are equal partners. Everything the UI can do, the agent can do via actions. The agent always knows what you're looking at via application state. See the root AGENTS.md for full framework documentation.

This is an **agent-native** presentation editor built with `@agent-native/core`.

## Resources

Resources are SQL-backed persistent files for storing notes, learnings, and context.

**At the start of every conversation, read these resources (both personal and shared scopes):**

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — user-specific context. Read both `--scope personal` and `--scope shared`.
2. **`LEARNINGS.md`** — app memory with user preferences and corrections. Read both scopes.

**Update `LEARNINGS.md` when you learn something important.**

### Resource scripts

| Action            | Args                                           | Purpose                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `resource-read`   | `--path <path> [--scope personal\|shared]`     | Read a resource         |
| `resource-write`  | `--path <path> --content <text> [--scope ...]` | Write/update a resource |
| `resource-list`   | `[--scope personal\|shared]`                   | List all resources      |
| `resource-delete` | `--path <path> [--scope personal\|shared]`     | Delete a resource       |

## Application State

Ephemeral UI state is stored in the SQL `application_state` table, accessed via `readAppState(key)` and `writeAppState(key, value)` from `@agent-native/core/application-state`.

| State Key          | Purpose                                                                                    | Direction                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `navigation`       | Current view, deck ID, slide number (1-based, UI-facing) and internal slide index          | UI -> Agent (read-only)    |
| `navigate`         | Navigate command (one-shot, auto-deleted)                                                  | Agent -> UI (auto-deleted) |
| `show-questions`   | Trigger question flow overlay in the UI                                                    | Agent -> UI                |
| `sidebarCollapsed` | Whether the left sidebar is collapsed (icon rail). Value: `{ "collapsed": true \| false }` | UI <-> Agent (both write)  |

### Navigation state (read what the user sees)

The UI writes `navigation` whenever the user navigates:

```json
{
  "view": "editor",
  "deckId": "abc123",
  "slideNumber": 3,
  "slideIndex": 2
}
```

Views: `"list"` (deck list), `"editor"` (editing a deck), `"present"` (presentation mode), `"settings"`.

**Slide numbers are 1-indexed everywhere users see or say them.** If the user asks for "slide 1", they mean `slideNumber: 1`, the first slide in the UI, and internal `slideIndex: 0`. Prefer `slideNumber` and slide IDs in all agent-facing reasoning. Treat `slideIndex` as an internal zero-based compatibility field only.

**Do NOT write to `navigation`** -- it is overwritten by the UI. Use `navigate` to move the user.

### Navigate command (control the UI)

```json
{ "deckId": "abc123" }
{ "view": "list" }
```

### Question Flow (structured questions before generating)

Write to `show-questions` to trigger a full-panel question overlay in the deck editor. The UI polls this key every 2 seconds. When questions are present, the overlay appears instead of the slide editor. When the user submits answers or skips, the UI sends the answers to agent chat and deletes the key.

Use guided questions for non-trivial net-new deck creation where audience, narrative, format, evidence, or visual direction would substantially change the output. Skip it for clear asks, small edits, or when the user explicitly says to decide.

#### Question Intensity

Users can tune this section in `AGENTS.md`:

| Mode       | Behavior                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `off`      | Never show guided questions; infer reasonable defaults.                   |
| `light`    | Ask only 1-2 blockers before high-effort generation.                      |
| `balanced` | Default. Ask 2-4 compact questions for ambiguous net-new decks.           |
| `deep`     | Ask 5-8 questions when audience, story, data, and design are all unclear. |

Default mode: `balanced`.

#### When to Ask Questions

| Scenario                                                      | Questions                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Complex/ambiguous request ("make me a deck about X")          | Ask 3-5 structured questions           |
| Specific request with clear direction ("10-slide sales deck") | Ask 1-3 clarifying questions           |
| Simple tweaks/follow-ups ("add a slide about Y")              | Skip questions, just do it             |
| "Decide for me" / "surprise me"                               | Zero questions — pick a bold direction |

#### show-questions Format

```json
{
  "title": "Shape the deck first",
  "description": "A few choices help me choose the right story and visual system.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "audience",
      "type": "text-options",
      "header": "Audience",
      "question": "Who is the primary audience?",
      "options": [

        { "label": "Team / Internal", "value": "internal" },
        { "label": "Customers / Prospects", "value": "customers" },
        { "label": "Conference / Public", "value": "conference" }
      ],
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "id": "tone",
      "type": "text-options",
      "question": "What tone should the deck have?",

        { "label": "Neutral", "value": "#64748B", "color": "#64748B" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "slide-count",
      "type": "slider",
      "question": "How many slides?",
      "min": 3,
      "max": 20
    },
    {

      "type": "freeform",
      "question": "Anything else the deck should include?",
      "description": "Key points, data, specific sections, etc."
    }
  ]
}
```

The payload can also include `skipLabel` and `submitLabel` when the default buttons need clearer wording.

#### Question Types

| Type            | UI             | Use for                                |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `text-options`  | Button group   | Audience, tone, style, purpose choices |
| `color-options` | Color swatches | Color mood, theme selection            |
| `slider`        | Range slider   | Slide count, density, intensity        |
| `file`          | File upload    | Brand assets, reference images, docs   |
| `freeform`      | Text area      | Additional context, specific needs     |

Each question has: `id` (unique key), `type`, `question` (label shown to user), optional `description`, optional `required` flag.
For `text-options` and `color-options`: provide `options` array with `label`/`value` (and `color` for color-options). Set `multiSelect: true` for multi-pick.
For `text-options`, provide 2-4 meaningful choices. Put the recommended/default option first, or mark it with `recommended: true` when the choice has a sensible default. Use short descriptions when the tradeoff is not obvious.
Questions can include optional `header` text. `text-options` may use `options` or `choices`.
When a deck has an active design system, color questions must use colors from that design system (primary, secondary, accent, surface/background) instead of generic moods.
For `slider`: provide `min`/`max`.

The UI automatically appends "Other..." with a custom text box, plus "Explore a few options" and "Decide for me" choices, to every `text-options` question. Do not add those manually.

#### Writing show-questions from an action or script

```typescript
import { writeAppState } from "@agent-native/core/application-state";

await writeAppState("show-questions", {
  questions: [
    /* ... */
  ],
});
```

The UI will pick it up on its next 2-second poll cycle and display the overlay.

## Data Model

All decks are stored in the `decks` SQL table via Drizzle ORM:

```sql
CREATE TABLE decks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  data TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Full deck JSON (slides, metadata)
  design_system_id TEXT,      -- Optional linked design system
  created_at TEXT,
  updated_at TEXT,
  owner_email TEXT,           -- Per-user owner (from ownableColumns)
  org_id TEXT,                -- Owner's active org at creation time
  visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'private'  -- 'private' | 'org' | 'public'
);
```

Each deck's `data` column contains a JSON object with `title` and `slides` array. Each slide has `id`, `content` (HTML), and optional `layout`.

## Agent Operations

**Always check the current screen before editing.** The user's view (which deck, which slide, scroll position) can change mid-conversation. Stale deck/slide IDs lead to editing the wrong thing.

### If you are the built-in agent-chat agent

A `<current-screen>` block is auto-injected into every user message with the current `deckId`, `currentSlideId`, and the full slide list. You don't need to call `view-screen` for the first action on a turn — the injected block is fresh. You **do** need to re-check if the user says "this slide" or "now do X" after several tool calls: the user may have navigated. When in doubt, call `view-screen`.

### If you are an external CLI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.)

You do NOT get auto-injected screen state. You MUST call `view-screen` yourself at the start of every task AND whenever you're about to edit a specific slide/deck. Do not rely on what was visible in previous turns — the user may have switched to a different slide since your last action.

**Rule of thumb:** run `pnpm action view-screen` before any `update-slide`, `add-slide`, or `create-deck --deckId` call to make sure you have the current `deckId` and `slideId`.

### Running actions

**Always use `pnpm action <name>` for operations** — never curl or raw HTTP.

Your shell cwd is this template's root (e.g., `templates/slides/`). Run actions directly:

```bash
pnpm action <name> [args]
```

If your cwd is the monorepo root instead (e.g., running from the Frame wrapper), prefix with `cd templates/slides &&`. Check with `pwd` if you're unsure. If `pnpm action` fails with "command not found" or "No such file", `cd` to the template root first.

`.env` is loaded automatically — **never manually set `DATABASE_URL` or other env vars**.

In the built-in agent chat, use the framework `manage-progress` tool for long-running generation work. Start it before multi-slide deck generation or design-system extraction, update the current step after each slide, and complete it when the user can see the finished result.

### Reading & Searching

| Action        | Args                                | Purpose                                                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view-screen` |                                     | See current UI state + context                                               |
| `list-decks`  | `[--compact] [--createdBy all\|me]` | List all accessible decks, optionally only decks created by the current user |
| `get-deck`    | `--id <deckId>`                     | Get a deck with all slides                                                   |

### Version History

Slides keeps SQL-backed deck snapshots before meaningful edits, so accidental overwrites can be rolled back after reloads. Restoring a version snapshots the current deck first, making restore reversible.

| Action                 | Args                                    | Purpose                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `list-deck-versions`   | `--deckId <id> [--limit 50]`            | List saved history snapshots for a deck     |
| `get-deck-version`     | `--deckId <id> --versionId <versionId>` | Inspect one saved snapshot before restoring |
| `restore-deck-version` | `--deckId <id> --versionId <versionId>` | Restore the deck to that saved snapshot     |

### Comments

| Action                | Args                                                                 | Purpose                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `list-slide-comments` | `--deckId <id> --slideId <id>`                                       | List comments on a slide    |
| `add-slide-comment`   | `--deckId <id> --slideId <id> --content "text" [--quotedText "..."]` | Add a comment to a slide    |
| `add-slide-comment`   | `--deckId <id> --slideId <id> --threadId <id> --content "reply"`     | Reply to an existing thread |

### Creating & Editing Slides

#### Factual Claims in Generated Decks

Do not invent factual numbers, metrics, URLs, source attributions, customer names, dates, success rates, benchmarks, or case-study results when generating or editing slides. Only include concrete factual claims when the user supplied them in the prompt/context or you fetched them with an action/tool.

If a metric or source would make the slide stronger but is not available, use qualitative language ("early signal", "strong coverage", "improving reliability"), a visible placeholder like `[metric TBD]`, or a clearly labeled draft assumption such as `Draft assumption: validate with QA data`. This is especially important for requests that arrive through Slack, Dispatch, or A2A, where the caller may only see the final deck URL and not any caveats in chat.

**Default flow — build a deck slide-by-slide (PREFERRED):**

1. If a deck is already open (check `<current-screen>` for `deckId`), skip to step 3.
2. Otherwise, create an empty deck: `create-deck --title "X" --slides '[]'`, then `navigate --deckId=<returned-id>`.
3. For decks larger than a few slides, start a `manage-progress` run so the header runs tray shows visible progress outside the chat pane. Update it after each slide and complete it when the requested slide count is reached.
4. Call `add-slide --deckId=<id> --content="<html>"` once per slide. Add slide 1 as soon as it is ready, wait for the action result, then add slide 2, and continue one-by-one in slide order until the requested slide count is reached. Do not fire multiple `add-slide` calls in parallel for the same deck; sequential writes are more reliable and still let the user watch the deck build live.

If the request is for a standalone visual, hero image, diagram, one-pager, poster, or only a couple visuals, make only the requested one/few polished visual slides. Do not pad the output into a conventional presentation.

**Why add-slide is preferred over create-deck with all slides:**

- The user sees slides stream in one-by-one (create-deck drops them all at once).
- Sequential `add-slide` calls keep the editor visibly filling in without making the user wait for the whole deck.
- If one slide fails, the others still land.

**Other operations:**

- **Replace one slide's content:** `update-slide --find/--replace` (surgical, syncs live via Yjs) or `--fullContent`.
- **Bulk replace (rare):** `create-deck --deckId <existing>` to atomically replace ALL slides in one deck.

| Action                     | Args                                                                                     | Purpose                                                               |

| `create-deck`              | `--title "X" --slides '[]' [--aspectRatio 16:9\|1:1\|9:16\|4:5] [--designSystemId <id>]` | Create a new empty deck (optionally set aspect ratio / design system) |

| `update-deck-aspect-ratio` | `--deckId <id> --aspectRatio 16:9\|1:1\|9:16\|4:5`                                       | Set the deck's aspect ratio (affects editor, presentation, PDF, PPTX) |

### Navigation

| `upload-image`     | `--data <data-url>` OR `--url <remote-url>` `[--filename ...]`                       | Upload any image to the configured provider, return CDN URL |

For image-generation prompts, create actual image assets with `generate-image`; do not substitute HTML/CSS placeholders, icon-only compositions, inline SVGs, or text-only mockups. Do not render visible text inside generated images unless the user explicitly asks for exact text. Style phrases like "make it look like Builder.io" are not brand-system setup requests; use a concise style interpretation and avoid browsing/searching/analyzing brand assets unless the user explicitly asks to set up, save, import, extract, or apply a design system.

When `IMAGES_A2A_URL` is configured, `generate-image` delegates to the Images app over A2A before falling back to the direct Gemini/OpenAI provider path. Use this path for brand/library-based slide imagery; keep the returned `assetId`, `runId`, `previewUrl`, `downloadUrl`, and `embedPath` with the slide so follow-up feedback can call the Images agent's `refine-image` flow by asset ID. See `.agents/skills/image-generation-via-a2a/SKILL.md`.

#### Chat-attached images (drag, paste, or attach into the agent composer)

When the user attaches an image to the chat, the framework pre-uploads it through the configured file-upload provider (Builder.io by default — or any provider registered via `registerFileUploadProvider`, e.g. S3 / R2 / GCS) BEFORE you see the message. The hosted URL is injected into your user message as a `<chat-image-attachment url="..." name="..." />` block at the bottom. **Use that `url` directly in `<img src="...">` when embedding the image on a slide — do not re-upload, do not refuse.** You still receive the image visually for vision/analysis.

If the user attaches an image and you instead see `<chat-image-attachment-upload-error>`, no file-upload provider is configured. Suggest the user configure one — call `connect-builder` for the recommended one-click Builder.io setup (free credits), or point them at `BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY` / a custom provider registered via `registerFileUploadProvider`. Until uploads are configured you can still see the image, but you cannot embed it on a slide as a URL.

#### Re-hosting other images (generated images, search results, remote URLs)

When `generate-image` or `image-search` returns a transient URL you want to preserve, or when you have an image as a base64 data URL from another tool, call `upload-image` to re-host it on whatever provider is configured. Use `--url` for remote URLs (`upload-image --url "https://..."`) and `--data` for inline data URLs.

### Design Systems

| Action                      | Args                                                                             | Purpose                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `create-design-system`      | `--title "X" [--description "..."] --data '<json>' [--customInstructions "..."]` | Create a new design system                                   |
| `update-design-system`      | `--id <id> [--title "X"] [--data '<json>'] [--customInstructions "..."]`         | Update design system tokens or custom instructions           |
| `get-design-system`         | `--id <id>`                                                                      | Get design system with all tokens (incl. customInstructions) |
| `list-design-systems`       | `[--compact]`                                                                    | List all accessible design systems                           |
| `set-default-design-system` | `--id <id>`                                                                      | Set one as the default                                       |
| `apply-design-system`       | `--deckId <id> --designSystemId <id>`                                            | Link a design system to a deck                               |
| `analyze-brand-assets`      | `[--websiteUrl "..."] [--companyName "..."] [--brandNotes "..."]`                | Gather brand data for analysis                               |

When generating slides for a deck that has a design system, **always use the design system's colors, fonts, and styles** instead of the default values. Check the design system with `get-design-system --id <id>` first.

If `get-design-system` returns a non-empty `customInstructions` string, treat it as user-authored guidance for this design system: follow it on every slide you generate while the deck is linked to that system, alongside the design tokens. Custom instructions override generic defaults but never override an explicit user request in the current turn.

### Import / Export

| Action                 | Args                                              | Purpose                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `import-file`          | `--filePath <path> [--format auto] [--deckId]`    | Import PPTX/DOCX/PDF to deck                         |
| `import-google-doc`    | `--url <google-doc-url-or-id> [--maxChars 60000]` | Extract text from a Google Doc link or selected Doc  |
| `import-pptx`          | `--filePath <path> [--deckId] [--title]`          | Direct PPTX import to deck                           |
| `import-docx`          | `--filePath <path>`                               | Extract DOCX content for slides                      |
| `export-pptx`          | `--deckId <id> [--includeNotes]`                  | Export deck as PowerPoint                            |
| `export-google-slides` | `--deckId <id> [--includeNotes]`                  | Export a PPTX plus Google Slides import instructions |
| `export-html`          | `--deckId <id>`                                   | Export as standalone HTML                            |
| `duplicate-deck`       | `--deckId <id> [--title]`                         | Create a copy of an existing deck                    |

If the user provides a Google Docs URL while asking for a deck, call `import-google-doc` before creating slides. Use the returned `text` as source material. Private Docs can be read after the user connects Google Docs and chooses the file through the picker, or when the Doc is shared with the configured service account. If the action still cannot read the Doc, relay the exact access instruction and do not invent slides from the URL alone.

### Sharing

Decks and design systems are **private by default** — only the creator sees them. To grant access to others, change the visibility or add explicit share grants. Use `resourceType deck` for decks and `resourceType design-system` for design systems. These actions are auto-mounted framework-wide:

| Action                    | Args                                                                                                                                                                                       | Purpose                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `share-resource`          | `--resourceType deck\|design-system --resourceId <id> --principalType user\|org --principalId <email-or-orgId> --role viewer\|editor\|admin --notify true\|false --resourceUrl /deck/<id>` | Grant a user or org access |
| `unshare-resource`        | `--resourceType deck\|design-system --resourceId <id> --principalType user\|org --principalId <email-or-orgId>`                                                                            | Revoke a share grant       |
| `list-resource-shares`    | `--resourceType deck\|design-system --resourceId <id>`                                                                                                                                     | Show visibility + grants   |
| `set-resource-visibility` | `--resourceType deck\|design-system --resourceId <id> --visibility private\|org\|public`                                                                                                   | Change coarse visibility   |

Read (`get-deck`, `list-decks`, `view-screen`) admits rows the current user owns, has been shared on, or that match the resource's visibility. Write (`create-deck --deckId`, `add-slide`, `update-slide`) requires the `editor` role or above; owners always satisfy. The separate `share-link` dialog (anonymous public URL via `share_token`) is orthogonal to this — anyone with the link can view regardless of visibility. See the `sharing` skill for the full model.

### Replying to Cross-App Callers (A2A)

When this agent is called via A2A (e.g. dispatch asking "make a deck about X"), the caller is in a different app and **cannot see your local UI state, navigation, or deck list**. They only see the text you put in your reply.

**After creating or modifying a deck, always include the canonical deck URL in your reply text — fully-qualified, never a relative path. Prefer the `url` returned by the deck action.**

```
<configured app URL>/deck/<deckId>
```

The URL pattern is `/deck/<id>` (singular `deck`). If constructing a URL manually, use the configured app URL for this running app, including any workspace mount path such as `APP_BASE_PATH=/slides`. Do not drop the base path when the Slides app is hosted inside a workspace.

**Examples — good vs bad replies for "Create a 3-slide deck about Acme Analytics. Reply with just the URL.":**

|     |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌  | "I'll create a 3-slide deck about Acme Analytics! Slide 1 — What is Acme Analytics? Slide 2 — Key features. Slide 3 — Get started." (no URL — caller has nothing to point to) |
| ❌  | "Created at `/deck/deck-123`" (relative path — caller's host won't resolve it)                                                                                                |
| ✅  | "https://workspace.example.com/slides/deck/deck-1777482594025-d7x2x" (verbatim, fully-qualified, just the URL the user asked for)                                             |

Same rule for `/deck/<id>/present` (presentation mode), `/share/<token>` (share link), and any other URL the caller might need.

## Slide HTML Templates

**Do NOT explore the codebase or call db-schema to understand slides.** Use these templates directly.

Every slide `content` is HTML. The slide renderer provides the black background — your HTML is the inner content.

### Fixed Canvas and Density Limits

Slides render into a fixed native canvas. The default 16:9 deck is **960x540 CSS pixels** and is scaled up by the renderer for larger editor and presentation viewports. After the standard `padding: 80px 110px`, a 16:9 slide has about 740x380 px of usable content space. Generate HTML for that fixed box, not for a 1920x1080 artboard.

Per-block density limits for 16:9 slides:

- Title slide: max 60-character heading, max 80-character subtitle, one optional short label.
- Section slide: max 40-character heading.
- Content slide: one heading up to 50 characters plus max 5 bullets, each up to 60 characters.
- Statement slide: max 100-character quote plus max 40-character attribution.
- Metrics slide: one heading plus max 4 metrics in one row or a 2x2 grid; each metric value max 12 characters and each label max 30 characters.
- Two- or three-column slide: each column max 4 lines, about 60 characters per line.
- Image or `.fmd-img-placeholder`: one image up to 320px tall, or one Mermaid diagram with little or no body text alongside it.

If the source material exceeds those limits, split it across additional slides instead of packing the slide tighter. The renderer **no longer auto-shrinks** overfull slides — vertical overflow used to be papered over with a uniform `transform: scale()` that left ugly right/bottom margins, so now the renderer keeps the slide at native size and the editor surfaces an "overflow" badge plus a "Fix with AI" button.

#### Auto-fix loop on overflow

`add-slide` and `update-slide` both wait briefly (3-5 s) for the editor to render and measure the slide they just wrote. If the slide overflows the canvas vertically, the action result includes a `layoutOverflow` object plus a `message` field with concrete numbers and a prioritized patch list. **When you see `layoutOverflow` in a tool result, immediately call `update-slide` on that slide to tighten it.** Prefer small surgical patches (`update-slide --find / --replace`) over a full rewrite — shorten one bullet, drop a low-value line, or shave padding. The next `update-slide` will run another fit-check, so you can keep tightening until the response no longer contains `layoutOverflow` (or the answer no longer changes — in which case split the slide across two). Pick (in order): tighten copy → reduce vertical density (fewer stacked cards, smaller gaps, slightly smaller body font but no smaller than 16px) → reduce slide padding (e.g. 40px top/bottom) → split across two slides. Do **not** try to "fix" overflow by adding `transform: scale()`, `overflow: scroll`, or absolute-positioned layers — only the HTML content shape can fix it now.

If `add-slide` / `update-slide` returns **without** a `layoutOverflow` field, the slide either fit or no editor was open to measure it (running headless / closed deck). Either way you should just move on.

### Metrics / Stats Slide

Use this layout only when the metric values are supplied by the user or retrieved with a tool/action. If values are unknown, replace numeric examples like `42%` and `10x` with placeholders (`[metric TBD]`) or qualitative labels; never turn a plausible example into a factual claim.

### Image Placeholder

When a slide needs a visual:

```html
<div
  class="fmd-img-placeholder"
  style="width: 100%; height: 300px; border-radius: 12px;"
>
  Description of what image should show
</div>
```

### Complete Example — 2-slide deck

```bash
pnpm action create-deck --title "My Deck" --slides '[
  {
    "id": "slide-1",
    "layout": "title",
    "content": "<div class=\"fmd-slide\" style=\"padding: 80px 110px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start; font-family: '\''Poppins'\'', sans-serif;\"><div style=\"font-size: 16px; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: 3px; text-transform: uppercase; color: #00E5FF; margin-bottom: 24px;\">2025</div><h1 style=\"font-size: 64px; font-weight: 900; color: #fff; line-height: 1.1; letter-spacing: -2px; margin: 0 0 24px 0;\">My Deck Title</h1><p style=\"font-size: 22px; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.55); margin: 0;\">Subtitle here</p></div>"
  },
  {
    "id": "slide-2",
    "layout": "content",
    "content": "<div class=\"fmd-slide\" style=\"padding: 80px 110px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: flex-start; font-family: '\''Poppins'\'', sans-serif;\"><div style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: 3px; text-transform: uppercase; color: #00E5FF; margin-bottom: 16px;\">OVERVIEW</div><h2 style=\"font-size: 40px; font-weight: 900; color: #fff; line-height: 1.15; letter-spacing: -1px; margin: 0 0 48px 0;\">Key Points</h2><div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 20px;\"><div style=\"display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8px; color: #fff; margin-top: 8px; flex-shrink: 0;\">&#x25CF;</span><span style=\"font-size: 22px; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.85); line-height: 1.5;\">First point</span></div><div style=\"display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8px; color: #fff; margin-top: 8px; flex-shrink: 0;\">&#x25CF;</span><span style=\"font-size: 22px; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.85); line-height: 1.5;\">Second point</span></div></div></div>"
  }
]'
```

Then navigate: `pnpm action navigate --deckId=<returned-id>`

## Delegating to Sub-Agents

When spawning a sub-agent for slide work, write an explicit task description — never vague. The sub-agent has the same actions you do and will use them if you tell it to.

**Always include in every slide sub-agent task:**

1. **The exact deckId** if working on an existing deck
2. **Preferred action**: `add-slide` for slide-by-slide generation, not `create-deck` with a huge slides array
3. **DO NOT tell it to read skills or explore** — the templates are in this AGENTS.md

**Example — filling an open deck (PREFERRED — sequential add-slide):**

```
The user has deck "deck-1234567-abc" open. Populate it with 5 slides about "AI trends in 2025".

Call add-slide once, wait for the result, then call it again for the next slide:
  add-slide --deckId "deck-1234567-abc" --content "<title slide HTML>"
  wait for result
  add-slide --deckId "deck-1234567-abc" --content "<slide 2 HTML>"
  wait for result
  add-slide --deckId "deck-1234567-abc" --content "<slide 3 HTML>"
  wait for result
  add-slide --deckId "deck-1234567-abc" --content "<slide 4 HTML>"
  wait for result
  add-slide --deckId "deck-1234567-abc" --content "<closing slide HTML>"

Use the slide HTML templates from the AGENTS.md. DO NOT use db-schema, search-files, resource-read, or shell.
```

**Example — creating a new deck from scratch:**

```
Create a new deck titled "AI Trends 2025" with 5 slides.

Step 1: create-deck --title "AI Trends 2025" --slides '[]'  (empty deck)
Step 2: navigate --deckId=<returned-id>
Step 3: Add 5 slides one-by-one with add-slide (same pattern as the "open deck" example above).

DO NOT bundle all slides into step 1's --slides array. Adding them one-by-one via add-slide lets the user watch the deck build live.
```

**If the user has a deck open** (visible in `<current-screen>`), include the `deckId` from the screen state in your task. Never make the sub-agent guess or discover the deckId on its own.

## Slide Styling Rules

- **Background**: `bg-[#000000]` (pure black) — set by the renderer, not your HTML
- **Font**: `font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif`
- **Headings**: `font-size: 40px; font-weight: 900; color: #fff`
- **Accent color**: `#00E5FF` (cyan)
- **Image placeholders**: `.fmd-img-placeholder` divs

**When a design system is active**, use its tokens instead of the defaults above. Call `get-design-system --id <id>` to get the current tokens: accent color, fonts, background color, etc. Replace `#00E5FF` with the design system's accent, `Poppins` with its heading/body font, `#000000` with its background.

## Agent Chat Integration

The app delegates complex operations to the agent chat via `sendToAgentChat()`. The image generation flow works through the agent chat for conversational follow-up.

## Content Generation: Positioning & Messaging

When generating outbound content (deck slides, marketing copy), use only the audience, positioning, source material, and proof points provided by the user or retrieved with actions/tools. The bundled template data is generic and must not be treated as vendor-specific positioning.

## Skills (for code editing only)

These skills are **only** needed when modifying source code, styles, or architecture. They are **not** needed for creating slides — the slide HTML templates above have everything you need for slide generation.

The framework auto-injects a `<skills>` block in your system prompt listing every available skill with its directory path and description. Skills are folders at `.agents/skills/<name>/` containing `SKILL.md` plus any supporting files.

Read a skill via shell (dev mode):

```
shell(command="cat .agents/skills/actions/SKILL.md")
shell(command="ls .agents/skills/actions/")
```

In production mode (no shell): critical content should be inlined in this AGENTS.md. For this template, all slide HTML templates are already inlined above — skills are only needed for code modification, which happens in dev.

## Inline Previews in Chat

The agent can embed a single slide directly inside a chat message using the framework's `embed` fence. This renders a chromeless iframe at `/slide` that shows one slide from a deck.

**How to emit an inline slide preview:**

````
```embed
src: /slide?deckId=<id>&slideNumber=<n>
aspect: 16/9
title: <slide title or description>
```
````

- `deckId` — the deck's `id` field (required).
- `slideNumber` — 1-based slide number to show, matching the UI (default: `1`).
- `slideIndex` — legacy zero-based index; avoid it unless maintaining an old embed URL.
- `aspect: 16/9` — always use 16/9 for slides.
- `title` — a short human-readable label shown above the iframe in chat.

The preview route (`app/routes/slide.tsx`) fetches the deck via `/api/decks/:id`, renders the slide using the same `SlideRenderer` used in the editor, and shows an "Open in app" button (visible only when running inside the embed) that navigates the main app to the deck's presentation view at the correct slide.

**Example — show slide 2 of deck `abc123`:**

````
```embed
src: /slide?deckId=abc123&slideNumber=2
aspect: 16/9
title: Slide 2 — Key Metrics
```
````

## API Routes

| Method | Route            | Description       |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| GET    | `/api/decks`     | List all decks    |
| POST   | `/api/decks`     | Create a new deck |
| GET    | `/api/decks/:id` | Get a deck        |
| PUT    | `/api/decks/:id` | Update a deck     |
| DELETE | `/api/decks/:id` | Delete a deck     |

## UI Components

**Always use shadcn/ui components** from `app/components/ui/` for all standard UI patterns (dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, tooltips, buttons, etc). Never build custom modals or dropdowns with absolute/fixed positioning — use the shadcn primitives instead.

**Always use Tabler Icons** (`@tabler/icons-react`) for all icons. Never use other icon libraries.

**Never use browser dialogs** (`window.confirm`, `window.alert`, `window.prompt`) — use shadcn AlertDialog instead.

## Visual Quality Standards — Anti-AI-Slop Rules

### Blacklisted Patterns (NEVER use these)

- Aggressive purple/blue gradients as primary backgrounds
- Left-border accent cards (the colored left stripe pattern)
- Emoji as icons — always use Tabler icons from `@tabler/icons-react`
- Inline SVG illustrations or hand-drawn SVG imagery
- Inter, Roboto, or Arial as primary fonts — use distinctive typography
- Fake statistics ("87% of users", "3x faster") — only real data
- Fake testimonials or quotes
- Generic stock-photo-style imagery
- Decorative sparkle/glow effects
- Excessive drop shadows or glassmorphism

### Required Quality Checks

- Body text minimum 22px on the 960x540 native slide canvas, 16px on web UI
- "Earn its place" — every element must justify its existence
- Empty space is solved with composition, not filler content
- When you think "adding this would look better" — that is usually a sign of AI slop
- Default to restraint: fewer elements, more whitespace, stronger hierarchy

### Modern CSS Techniques to Use

- `text-wrap: balance` for headings, `text-wrap: pretty` for body
- `oklch()` color space for perceptually uniform color manipulation
- CSS Grid with named areas for complex layouts
- `color-mix()` for dynamic color variants
- Container queries for component-responsive design
- `:has()` selector for parent-based styling

## Design Philosophy Reference

When the user's request is vague about visual direction, recommend from these schools:

### Information Architecture School

- **Pentagram**: Grid-first, black/white/red, structured information hierarchy
- **Stamen Design**: Data-driven, cartographic precision, clear visual encoding

### Motion Poetics School

- **Locomotive**: Smooth scroll, parallax depth, cinematic pacing
- **Active Theory**: WebGL experiments, particle systems, immersive 3D
- **Field.io**: Generative art, algorithmic beauty, mathematical precision

### Minimalism School

- **Experimental Jetset**: Swiss typography, geometric forms, pure structure
- **Muller-Brockmann**: Grid systems, objective communication, typographic hierarchy
- **Build**: Reduction to essence, mono-font, pure whitespace

### Eastern Philosophy School

- **Kenya Hara**: Ma (negative space), simplicity as depth, emptiness as design
- **Takram**: Craft meets technology, material honesty, subtle animation

**Key insight**: Describe mood, not layout. Short emotional prompts outperform detailed layout specifications.

## Slide Design Patterns

### Batch Production Strategy

Always make 2 showcase slides first to lock the visual grammar before scaling:

1. Generate 2 hero slides (title + key content)
2. Get user approval on the visual language
3. Then produce remaining slides following the established grammar

### Slide Layout Types

- **Title**: Large heading, minimal text, strong visual impact
- **Data**: Charts, numbers, clear data visualization
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side, before/after, pros/cons
- **Timeline**: Sequential events, process flows
- **Quote**: Large pull quote with attribution
- **Gallery**: Image grid with captions
- **Code**: Syntax-highlighted code with annotations

### Typography on Slides

- Heading: 48-72px on the 960x540 native slide canvas
- Body: 22-32px minimum
- Caption: 18-20px
- Use `font-variation-settings` for weight morphing (if variable font available)
- Two-tier shadow: 1px tight shadow + 8px ambient shadow (never single shadow)

---

## Brand Asset Protocol

When using design system tokens in generated content, follow this hierarchy:

1. Logo > Product Photo > UI Screenshot > Colors > Fonts
2. Always verify brand colors from the design system — never approximate
3. Use design system's `imageStyle.styleDescription` in image generation prompts
4. Reference design system's `typography.headingFont` and `bodyFont`
5. Apply design system's spacing and border tokens consistently
